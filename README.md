# MancJS
## Offline Application Walkthrough

The tutorial will take place at the [MancJS](http://mancjs.com/) meetup in August, on the 7th at 7pm in [TechHub Manchester](manchester.techhub.com).

Before the session starts I will push the following staged branches to help walk through the process:

* __stage-0__ the basic application
* __stage-1__ an offline appcache file to trigger offline mode
* __stage-2__ css attached to the appcache to render properly when offline
* __stage-3__ application working online after breaking between stages 0-2
* __stage-4__ application works fully offline
* __stage-5__ changes to the JS application and how to make sure we update our code
* __stage-6__ letting the user know that there's a change
* __stage-7__ localStorage to save the state of our application
